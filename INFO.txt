Implementation of different Computational Geometry algorithms for solving the Art-Gallery Problem.

1. Construct a simple polygon with n vertices. The application take n as input (e.g., 20) from
the user, then randomly generate n distinct points with x and y coordinates in 2D geometry. 

2. Perform Trapezoidalization of the simple polygon obtained above . Obtain Monotone Polygons from the Trapezoidalization of the simple polygon. 

3. For each monotone partition (polygon), perform triangulation using the line-sweep (plane-sweep) algorithm.
